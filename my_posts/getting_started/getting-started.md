Eggspress is a lightweight blogging platform built on Next.js and React. It's designed to help anyone launch a new website with little to no coding experience. There's no command line needed. Best of all, it's lightning fast and completely free![^1]

## Why Eggspress?
Aside from being fast and free, Eggspress provides a core set of features that cover most authors' needs.

Use it to start your next personal blog, or share your professional know-how through a technical blog. Want to market your products and services? Eggspress can do that. Want to generate income from an affiliate marketing blog? Eggspress can do that too.

You could even use Eggspress to host documentation and step-by-step guides like the one you're reading now.

When you use Eggspress, your content belongs to you. Although this guide focuses on Github and Vercel, you're not bound to either of these platforms.

If you ever feel that it's time to move to another blogging platform, just move your files. Eggspress uses Markdown, which is a widely-used standard for styling documents on the web.

Of course, if you use Eggspress, we'd love for you to stay. If you have feedback or suggestions, [create an issue](https://github.com/dentonzh/Eggspress/issues/new) with your comments or email your thoughts to eggspressblog [at] gmail.

### Why not Eggspress?
Eggspress is a new platform. As a result, it doesn't have the same breadth of plugins, themes, and tools made for it. If you need more bells and whistles than what Eggspress offers, you may want to look elsewhere.

Because it's "CMS-less," Eggspress lacks a sleek interface for managing your site. Every setting and every bit of content you change on Eggspress is done by modifying a file or creating a new file.

For the best possible experience, we recommend setting up and publishing to Eggspress using a computer.
