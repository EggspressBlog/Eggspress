This is the documentation site for [Eggspress](https://github.com/dentonzh/Eggspress), an **open-source project** that helps you **find your voice** on the Internet.

On Eggspress, there are **no algorithms** that decide which of your content deserves more views.[^1] There's **no friction** thrown in the way of your visitors and your work.[^2]

Your voice is yours alone. You decide when, where, and how you want to use it.

## Your content can live anywhere
Eggspress is easiest to set up on Github and Vercel, two services with generous free tiers. We use them to host this Docs site and we also use these when showing you [how to set up](my_posts/getting_started/getting-started.md) your own Eggspress site.

Those aren't the only places where you can host your content, however. In fact, you can set up Eggspress on any modern cloud provider. You can even host it yourself at home.

Deploy your site in one place and keep it there forever. Or move from server to server, cloud provider to cloud provider, as you see fit.

Decide Eggspress isn't for you? Eggspress uses [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), which is widely used and close to [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/). You'll be able to migrate away from Eggspress to any other Markdown-based site or blog platform with relative ease.

## Speed and simplicity
Out of the box, Eggspress is blisteringly fast.

That's because it prioritizes simplicity. Pages are minimal—your content comes first—but deliver core features that satisfy most authors and readers.[^3]

Everything is fine-tuned for speed. Even visitors on slower connections and devices will fly through your pages with fast load times.[^4]

## Extensible
Eggspress uses MDX, which allows authors to add custom (React) components directly into their content.

Insert charts, interactive diagrams, live market data, and much more with these components.

Learn more about how to [create / add your own components](my_posts/guide/create-custom-components.md).


[^1]: If you want to be discovered by new visitors, you'll still be subjected to the whims of search engines like Google. Thankfully, Eggspress comes SEO-ready, meaning your content will be optimized to appear in search indexes
[^2]: Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn have always had a sign-in wall that require visitors to register and login before viewing content posted to them—X (formerly Twitter) and Medium have recently hopped on this bandwagon
[^3]: Presently, there are no reaction buttons (e.g. likes) or comments on Eggspress
[^4]: Eggspress uses a compact version of Google Analytics, so you can even keep Analytics on without it affecting speed
